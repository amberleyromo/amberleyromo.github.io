Still struggling with the attention span. Since most of my workday has to do with the strategy/management side, I now haven't really worked with code in a couple of months. 

I'm trying to fix this in two ways. 1) By formalizing a partnership with a co-worker to help keep myself accountable. 2) By committing to work through tutorials and projects beginning to end, start to finish, without starting any others in between. 

I'm starting with [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails) and following that will start work on [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). 

Will have some good downtime over the holidays to knock out a bunch and get some momentum going. I'm particularly excited to have such support at work now. The accountability and structure is really important for me, and difficult to enforce.
