It's truly hilarious to rediscover the handful of posts that exist here. I originally created this repo almost exactly three years ago. There have been a lot of posts going around about the importance of structure in your learning objectives, which is something I have long struggled with (I spread myself far too thin). I'm resurrecting this from the dead to try once again to give myself some structure and keep track of what I'm working on. This year in many facets of my life I've learned a lot about grit -- sustained effort over time. I'm trying to focus more on the consistency, rather than periodic bursts. I hope to apply that here, and keep random notes about trying to live in a non-zero system, where the effort is the goal.
