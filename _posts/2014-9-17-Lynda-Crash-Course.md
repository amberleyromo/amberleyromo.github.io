**TIL:** 

So after having that talk yesterday, I'm diving in 100% to PHP. I finally got myself an account on Lynda.com, and it's way better than I expected. So far all of it is stuff I'm familiar with (which is cool, actually). Excited to keep going.

Also something happened with my bash_profile again. I'm starting to worry something's up with my computer, but at least I know how to fix that issue now. So.. glad I figured that out.
