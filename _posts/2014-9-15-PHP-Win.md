**TIL:** 

Today, I successfully implemented custom fields in a Wordpress template, using PHP. I was pathetically beside myself. The first several times I reuploaded the functions file, I got the white screen of death. And finally there it was-- the content in from the custom fields. Unstyled (til tomorrow) but who cares (I will tomorrow). Styling is territory I'm happy with.

I also learned how to block access to a page by [editing the .htaccess file](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11728976/how-to-deny-access-to-a-file-in-htaccess). *Note: read more about .htaccess.*
